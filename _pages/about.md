Hello!

I am Benny. I am building Generative AI models and products for Ads at Meta. I earned my **Master of Computational Data Science degree at Carnegie Mellon University**'s [Language Technology Institue](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor [Eric Nyberg](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/).

Before joining CMU, I earned my **B.A. with high distinction in Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley**.

Here is my [resume](assets/pdf/BennyResume.pdf).
