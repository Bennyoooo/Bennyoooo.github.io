Hello!

I am Benny, a first-year Master of Computational Data Science student at Carnegie Mellon University's [Language Technology Institue](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), where I'm fortunate to be advised by Professor [Eric Nyberg](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ehn/).

Before joining CMU, I earned my B.A. with high distinction in Computer Science and Data Science at UC Berkeley.

Here is my [resume](assets/pdf/BennyResume.pdf).
